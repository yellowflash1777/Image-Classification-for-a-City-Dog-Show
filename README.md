# Image-Classification-for-a-City-Dog-Show
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information. You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.
